# How does evolution through natural selection work?
# What is the chance of getting 1000 sixes with 1000 dice?
# If you only throw once: 1/6^1000 =
# 7.059 Ã— 10^-779 (see https://www.wolframalpha.com/)
# But if you keep the sixes after each throw, then after just 40 throws
# the chance is 50% that you have 1000 sixes.

# Number of replicates
tests <- 10000

# Function that will throw die
throw.die <- function(dice = 1000) {
  sixes <- 0              # Start with 0 sixes 
  throws <- 0             # Start without throwing
  while (sixes != dice) { # If nb of sixes is NOT equal to nb of die, continue. 
    throws <- throws + 1  # Add one to count the number of throws (a trhow is tossing ALL non-six dice at the same time)
    # Get a vector will all possible faces of all die that were not 0 
    throw.all = sample(x = 1:6,           # Get faces of a dice 
                       size = dice-sixes, # Nb of die minus number of sixes represent the NON-6 die that need to be tossed 
                       replace = TRUE)    # Replace as there will be more die than the number of faces 
    nb.six = length(which(throw.all==6))  # Count the number of 6s in the data 
    sixes = sixes + nb.six                # Add the nubmer of sixes to the previous counts from the new throw
  }
  return(throws)           # Return number of throws 
}
